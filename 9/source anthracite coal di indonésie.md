## Interface Properties and Floatability of Anthracite Coal
In China,the coal is currently the important energy source.Flotation is one of the most common methods for ﬁne coal de ashing that cannot be achieved by gravity separation [1 4].It is based on di erent wetting properties between organic matters and gangue particles.Coal is inherently hydrophobic.How much carbon dioxide is produced when different fuels.The amount of CO2 produced when a fuel is burned is a function of the carbon content of the fuel.The heat content,or the amount of energy produced when a fuel is burned,is mainly determined by the carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) content of the fuel.Heat is produced when C and H combine with oxygen (O) during combustion.
