## Coal in the 21st Century Read Online
Coal has been the fastest growing energy source in recent years and is essential for many industrial activities,but the coal industry is hugely damaging for the environment.A major driver in climate change and causing around 40% of the world's carbon dioxide emissions,coal fuel comes at a high environmental price.CoalWith coal generation growing faster than power generation,this is the only region where coal's share in the power mix increased in 2018.In Japan and Korea,coal demand posted a small decline in 2018,a change from the substantial growth in demand in 2017.

Coal is a combustible black or brownish black sedimentary rock,formed as rock strata called coal seams.Coal is mostly carbon with variable amounts of other elements; chiefly hydrogen,sulfur,oxygen,and nitrogen.Coal is formed when dead plant matter decays into peat and is converted into coal by the heat and pressure of deep burial over millions of years.Coke (fuel) WikipediaCoke is a grey,hard,and porous fuel with a high carbon content and few impurities,made by heating coal or oil in the absence of air — a destructive distillation process.It is an important industrial product,used mainly in iron ore smelting,but also as a fuel in stoves and forges when air pollution is a concern.The unqualified term "coke" usually refers to the product derived from low.

## What is coal?: Lets talk about coal
The burning of fossil fuels is driving climate change.All of us collectively,globally,including the coal industry face the challenge of reducing CO2 emissions to stabilise average surface temperatures,as agreed by 195 countries (including New Zealand) in Paris in late 2015.Urbanization,Steel Demand,and Raw Materials.Integrated steel making (i.e.non recycled steel) is primarily based on iron ore and coking coal (i.e.metallurgical coal).For each tonne of steel that is produced,about 1400 kg of iron ore and 800 kg of coal are required.1 Due to this,the production of steel is the second largest use of coal after power generation.Over 70% of steel produced in 2013 was generated using direct coal input.
