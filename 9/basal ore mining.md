Variable mineral chemistry and textures of basal Negaunee iron ores mined in the Main Tilden Pit have led to metallurgical difficulties.Core logging and detailed petrography supported by microprobe investigations,identify three upward fining lithofacies within the Main Pit Carbonate and overlyingWhat is vein mining answersIf you do,then if you see a vein and you have a mining pick equipped,then you can right click on the vein and you will start mining for ore. prospecting comes with the jewelcrafting.

## Mining Methods Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
The ore reserves,though large,are not so immense that mining methods involving a sacrifice of ore or its dilution by waste for the sake of cheaper mining costs have ever been used.The following examples are typical of the mining methods in use.Geology of Mauritania WikipediaThe extraction of mineral resources requires access to the ore body through underground workings,or open pit operations,or through drillholes for solution mining.
