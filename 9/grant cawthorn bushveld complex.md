## Bushveld Complex geological formation,South Africa.
The Bushveld Complex underlies an area of about 50,000 square km (20,000 square miles); and the Great Dyke of Zimbabwe,another layered complex,has been traced for more than 480 km (300 miles).Anorthosite is also found on the lunar surface.of magnetite from the Bushveld Complex,South AfricaAbstract.are found in pure magnetitite layers in the upper zone of the Bushveld Complex.Detailed electron microprobe analysis of one of these indicates avertical compositional zoning of Cr (a highly compatible lement in magnetite) quite different from the concentric zonation often found,for example,in feldspars in intrusive rocks.

## Bushveld Igneous Complex Wikipedia
The Bushveld Igneous Complex (BIC) is the largest layered igneous intrusion within the Earth's crust.It has been tilted and eroded forming the outcrops around what appears to be the edge of a great geological basin: the Transvaal Basin.It is approximately 2 billion years old and is divided into four different limbs: the northern,southern,eastern,and western limbs.Immiscible iron and silica rich liquids in the Upper Zone.Immiscible iron and silica rich liquids in the Upper Zone of the Bushveld Complex Lennart A.Fischera,b,*,Meng Wanga,Bernard Charliera,c,Olivier Namura,R.James Robertsd,Ilya V.Vekslere,R.Grant Cawthornf,François Holtza a Institut für Mineralogie,Leibniz Universität Hannover,30167 Hannover,Germany b School of Physical Sciences,University of Tasmania,Hobart 7001,Australia

## Studies of the Rooiberg Group,Bushveld Complex,South.
It has been suggested that the Bushveld Complex of South Africa could be the result of multiple large meteorite or comet impacts.According to this hypothesis,part of the lower Rooiberg Group,which forms the roof of the Complex,represents a sheet of impact melt breccia and other impact breccias.Cawthorn,R.Grant [WorldCat Identities]Written by leading experts in the field,this work summarises the important aspects relating to layered intrusions,with almost universal coverage of the subject.Each chapter is a complete review of a theme or specific geological intrusion.The first part of the book covers the general principles.

## Parental magma to the Bushveld Complex Nature
Sep 04,1980 · The Bushveld Complex of South Africa is a large layered intrusive suite of cumulate rocks for which the parental magma is not directly obtainable.Emplacement and Crystallization Time for the Bushveld ComplexIntroduction.The Bushveld Complex (BC) is a large layered intrusion,emplaced into a stable cratonic setting.It has been considered an intrusive equivalent of a continental flood basalt province,and inferred to be related to a mantle plume (Hatton,1995).The duration of continental flood basaltic magmatism may be of the order of several million years.

## The Bushveld Complex,South Africa SpringerLink
May 19,2015 · Abstract.The mafic rocks of the Bushveld Complex,South Africa,were emplaced into a stable cratonic shield some 2.06 b.y.ago,and have remained remarkably well preserved from deformation,metamorphism and low temperature alteration,at least partly by its isostatic impact on the entire crustal thickness.The Residual or Roof Zone of the Bushveld Complex,South.R.Grant Cawthorn.in.The geological succession of an area in the southeastern Bushveld Complex,South Africa is described here,in which up to 700 m of monzonitic rocks,more evolved than in currently proposed stratigraphic sections of the Bushveld,have been identified beneath the Rooiberg Group felsites,the roof rocks to the intrusion.

## Emplacement and Crystallization Time for the Bushveld Complex
Sep 01,1998 · Introduction.The Bushveld Complex (BC) is a large layered intrusion,emplaced into a stable cratonic setting.It has been considered an intrusive equivalent of a continental flood basalt province,and inferred to be related to a mantle plume (Hatton,1995).The duration of continental flood basaltic magmatism may be of the order of several million years.About Us Welcome to Shango SolutionsProf Grant Cawthorne (Bushveld Complex) Dr Clive Feather (Laboratory Audits) Mr Bernie Green (Geophysicist) Ophir Drilling and Exploration) Mr Tammo Vink (Legal) Powered by WordPress and Dynamic News.

CHAPTER Two: OVERVIEW OF THE BUSHVELD COMPLEX.(Eales and Cawthorn,1996).Cawthorn and Webb (2001) proposed that Hall's initial model was correct,in that the eastern and the western limb of the Bushveld Complex are linked and formed within a single lopolithic intrusion.Their proposition is largely based on the lithological and.Vertical chemical gradients in a single grain of magnetite.of magnetite from the Bushveld Complex,South Africa R.GRANT CAWTHORN,T.S.McCARTHY,AND G.DAVIES Department of Geology,University of the Witwatersrand,Jan Smuts Avenue,Johannesburg 2001,South Africa A B S T R A C T.Very large crystals of magnetite,up to 2 cm,
