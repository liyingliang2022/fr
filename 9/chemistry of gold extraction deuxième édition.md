Separation and purification,in chemistry,separation of a substance into its components and the removal of impurities.There are a large number of important applications in fields such as medicine and manufacturing.Separations and purifications also find their places in medicine and the sciences.Organogold chemistry WikipediaOrganogold chemistry is the study of compounds containing gold carbon bonds.They are studied in academic research,but have not received widespread use otherwise.The dominant oxidation states for organogold compounds are I with coordination number 2 and a linear molecular geometry and III with CN = 4 and a square planar molecular geometry.The first organogold compound discovered was gold.

## Amalgam (chemistry) Wikipedia
Gold extraction (mining) Gold amalgam has proved effective where gold fines ("flour gold") would not be extractable from ore using hydro mechanical methods.Large amounts of mercury were used in placer mining,where deposits composed largely of decomposed granite slurry were separated in long runs of "riffle boxes",with mercury dumped in at.
