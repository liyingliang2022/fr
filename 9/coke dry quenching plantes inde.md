## Tata Steel sets up Coke Dry Quenching facility at Odisha
KOLKATA: Tata Steel has set up India's largest Coke Dry Quenching (CDQ) facility at its state of the art greenfield steel plant located at the Kalinganagar,Odisha.CDQ is a heat recovery system to cool the hot coke from coke ovens.It is one of the most renowned energy efficient and environment.SOLUTION 1 SOLUTION 2• CDQ (Coke Dry Quenching) is a gradual coke quenching system,and improves coke strength and coke size distribution.Consequently,while the blending ratio of inexpensive non or slightly caking coal for coke oven material is only approx.15% in case of CWQ (Coke Wet Quenching) system,it can be increased up to approx.30% by CDQ,

## quencing process in coke plant used in tata steel
When generating electric power by utilizing the steam produced by coke dry quenching process,one coke unit which has a treating capacity of 100T H,can generate about 18MW electric power,which can be used for other energy services.A typical savings calculation from a coke dry quenching process plant is presented in the figure below.BUILD INDUSTRIAL PAKISTAN: Coke Oven & By Product Plant.The red hot coke is pushed out of the oven by pusher car through a guide into coke bucket which is transported with an Electric Locomotive to the Coke Wet or Dry Quenching Plant.In wet quenching heat energy of hot coke cannot be utilized because water is directly showered on hot coke & the steam is evaporated in the air.

## Improving coke plant efficiency by dry quenching with.
The energy efficiency of a coke plant may be increased if natural gas is used in dry quenching of the coke.The heat from the decomposition products of the natural gas is employed to boost steam generation in the waste heat boiler.In addition,the solid carbon produced in decomposition increases the coke.
