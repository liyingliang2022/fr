## Silver Wikipedia
Silver is an extremely soft,ductile and malleable transition metal,though it is slightly less malleable than gold.Silver crystallizes in a face centered cubic lattice with bulk coordination number 12,where only the single 5s electron is delocalized,similarly to copper and gold.Silver: A native element,mineral,alloy,and byproductMost of the silver produced today is a byproduct of mining copper,lead,and zinc.The silver occurs within the ores of these metals in one of two ways: 1) substituting for one of the metal ions within the ore mineral's atomic structure; or,2) occurring as an inclusion of native silver or a silver mineral within the ore.
