## A Review of the Production Cycle of Titanium Dioxide Pigment
The geology of titanium mineral deposits was reviewed by Force [8],and their world production and reserves has been summarized by Gambogui in different years (2009,2010,and 2011) [4] [9] [10].More than half of the world's titanium production is from ilmenite and rutile in shoreline placer deposits in Australia,South Africa,Metallic Deposits CliffsNotesThe ore minerals in most of the world's iron and manganese reserves were chemically precipitated in the ocean and accumulated on the sea floor.Placer deposits are heavy metallic minerals,such as iron or titanium minerals,or native gold or diamonds,that have been concentrated by wave or water action in a river or beach environment.The.
