## Main Features of a modern Wire Rod Mill IspatGuru
Modern wire rod mills are high speed mills capable of rolling of smaller dimensions at high production rates,while at the same time keeping investments and operating costs at the reasonable levels.As a rule,wire rod mills are designed for an annual output of between 300,000 t and over 800,000 t (two strand mills).Rolling of Metals: Process and Principles (With Diagram)The rolling process is shown in Fig.2.1: Rolling is done both hot and cold.It is accomplishes in rolling mills.A rolling mill is a complex machine having two or more working rollers,supporting rollers,roll stands,drive motor,reducing gear,flywheel,coupling gear etc.Rollers may be plain or grooved depends upon the shape of rolled product.

## What is a Rod Mill? (with picture)
Dec 31,2019 · Common examples are rod and ball mills,both of which are of the rotary drum type which rely on internal grinding agents to achieve their milling action.Unlike the ball mill which utilizes a large number of hardened steel balls to impart the grinding action,the rod mill uses steel rods lying within the drum and parallel to its axis.Rod Mill for sale,Rod Mill Process,Rod Mill MachineRod mills are very similar to ball mills,except they use long rods for grinding media.The rods grind the ore by tumbling within the the mill.To prevent the conditions leading to rod charge tangling,the length to diameter ratio is maintained at 1.4 to 1.6.
