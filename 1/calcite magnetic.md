## Concretion Wikipedia
A concretion is a hard,compact mass of matter formed by the precipitation of mineral cement within the spaces between particles,and is found in sedimentary rock or soil.Concretions are often ovoid or spherical in shape,although irregular shapes also occur.The word 'concretion' is derived from the Latin con meaning 'together' and crescere meaning 'to grow'.Specimen Identification Guide Public Clemson.Calcite (calcium carbonate): a very common mineral,especially in caves and as a secondarily deposited druze.Calcite crystals are typically rhombohedral,scalenohedral or prismatic and come in a variety of colors (most commonly white or yellow but sometimes blue,pink or green).
