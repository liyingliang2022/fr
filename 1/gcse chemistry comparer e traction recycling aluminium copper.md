## Types of Extraction S cool,the revision website
Methods of extraction Many metals are found in the Earth's crust as ores.An ore is usually a compound of the metal mixed with impurities.When the metal is dug up,a method must be used to separate the metal from the rest of the ore.This is called extracting the metal.The method of extraction depends on how reactive the metal is.The more reactive the metal,the more difficult it is to.Extracting copper.Recycling.New scrap comes from factories which make articles from copper,brass or bronze.Their machines will produce offcuts and shavings that can be collected and returned for recycling.Copper is made with different purities depending on the application.The highest grade copper is electrical grade.It is 99.99% pure and is used for electrical cables.

## GCSE CHEMISTRY Extraction of Copper Thermal.
Extraction of Metals.Extraction of Copper.Copper is sometimes found as native metal.Copper ores include copper(II) oxide and copper(II) sulfide.Copper(II) oxide can be reduced by reaction with carbon.Some copper ores may contain only small amounts of copper.These are called low grade ores and have less than 1% copper but they are still used because copper is so valuable.GCSE Science Chemistry (9 1) RecyclingDec 25,2017 · In this video,we look at the importance of recycling and reusing materials.Deliberate Thought by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution licence ( https: creativecommons.
