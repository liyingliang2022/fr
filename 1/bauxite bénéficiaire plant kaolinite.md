The silica or clay mineral content is the next most important,and is used for grade determination of the bauxite,as high silica causes problems in the processing of bauxite to alumina.The predominant clay mineral is either kaolinite or halloysite,and a high grade bauxite contains 1 3% of this mineral determined as SiO 2.Chapter 2.Production and Processing of AluminumAccording to the grade of the bauxite ore,2 3 tonnes of ore yield one tonne of alumina and about one tonne of red mud (dry weight).When designing an alumina plant,factors other than the type of bauxite ore to be used as feed material and the form of alumina to be produced have to be taken into consideration.A high silica content of the.

## Bauxite Formation The Bauxite Index
Bauxite deposits are formed chiefly by weathering of aluminous rock; some have been transported to their present locations,but most are residual accumulations from which most other constituents of the parent rock,other than alumina,have been leached.Bauxite deposits occur in rocks ranging in age from Precambrian to Holocene.Bauxite Crushing Plant,Bauxite Mining CrusherBauxite Crushing Plant In the modern mining processing line,bauxite is an important raw material which is used to produce aluminum.Bauxite can be widely used in many industries,among which the most important is to be used to refining aluminum,working as refractory and abrasive materials,and raw materials for high alumina cement.

## Is Low Silica in Bauxite a Problem in Bayer Alumina Plant
Generally,it has been seen from bauxite analysis that Reactive silica in bauxite ranges from 50% to 80% out of Total silica in bauxite.Plant operation is affected because of high silica in bauxite as it has high settling velocity and abnormally high abrasive nature.(PDF) Beneficiation of Bauxite Upgrading of Recoverable.In the Bayer plant,bauxite mineralogy affects process efficiency by driving the chemical reactions that occur in the process.If the Run Of Mine (ROM) bauxite is of lower quality,in some cases the beneficiation by means of physical separation process is economical feasible.
