## Iron ore Wikipedia
Increasing iron ore demand,coupled with the depletion of high grade hematite ores in the United States,after World War II led to development of lower grade iron ore sources,principally the utilization of magnetite and taconite.Iron ore mining methods vary by the type of ore being mined.Mining Colomi IronDevelopment of the Colomi South deposits on the south side of Sobradinho Lake is the priority with target production of 25Mtpa.The mine will produce a high grade magnetite rich iron ore concentrate using standard beneficiation methods.Initial mine life is 20 years.
