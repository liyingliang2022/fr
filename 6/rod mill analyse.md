## Lab Rod Mill
Laboratory Rod Mill is a lab grinding equipment for wet or dry grinding of ore.It is applied in labs for processing and fine grinding of artificial placer materials and ores in metallurgical,building material,chemical,light,coal,water conservancy,electric power,agricultural and geological industries.Rod mills,how they functionRod mills normally carry 35 to 65% rod charge by volume.The limits on charge level are (1) keeping the feed end trunnion open so that feed will get into the mill,and (2) keeping the rod charge low so rods will not work their way into discharge openings where they can cause rod tangling.

Rod mills operate at lower speed than ball mills since the rods are rolled and not cascaded.For an equivalent grind,a rod mill uses less steel than a ball mill because of the lower speed and better contact between the media and ore.The rod charge must be maintained in good working condition,and broken and worn rods must be removed.PowerPoint PresentationScreen Brushy Creek Crushing Circuit Rod Mill Ore from Underground Reclaim Ore Secondary Crusher Fines Chute Vibratory Feeder Oversize Ore Through Crusher Fine Ore (minus 5 8") Fine Ore (minus 5 8") To Rod Mill Grinding Brushy Creek Grinding Circuit Rod Mill Ball Mill Cyclone Feed Sump 4 Cyclones Cyclone Feed Pump Water Discharge Water.
