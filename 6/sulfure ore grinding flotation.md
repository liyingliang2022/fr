## SRU Sulphur Recovery Process
THE Sulfur Recovery FLOWSHEET.The flowsheet above is a typical example of economical treatment of low grade sulphur by flotation.Due to the variable nature of the sulphur in these deposits,testwork,such as is offered by the 911metallurgy Equipment Company and Laboratories,is recommended to determine the exact flowsheet requirements.Information obtained from these tests will determine the.Copper processing Ores BritannicaFor sulfide ores,on the other hand,selective flotation normally follows the crushing and grinding stage and requires an optimal degree of liberation.In the flotation process,the finely ground ore,mixed with water and special reagents,is agitated by mechanical and pneumatic devices.These produce air bubbles in the ore water mixture,or.

The metal content of ore measured in grams per tonne or per cent.For example,a grade of 40% iron implies 400kg of contained iron for each 1,000kg of ore.Grinding: Means of reducing ore into very small particles by means of pressure or impact.Different types of grinders are used in the processing plant to obtain the desired dimension.grinding ores with sulfurCopper Ore Grinding Machine.Copper Ore Grinding Machine The content of copper ore flotation and ease of iron sulfide ore closely According to the number of sulfide copper ore iron sulfide content divided into two categories,one is dense massive copper ore,one is disseminated copper ore one of the main reasons is the copper from the mill.
