## SIMULTANEOUS AIRBORNE DUST SAMPLES WITH KONIMETER.
Dec 01,1977 · Abstract.Simultaneous airborne dust samples were taken with three types of instruments: konimeter,thermal precipitator and dosimeter (personal sampler with membrane filter) in eight asbestos mines producing four types of asbestos.Escort Elf Personal Sampling Pumps Zefon InternationalThe Escort line of personal air sampling pumps can operate at flow rates ranging from.5 3.0 LPM.They require little ongoing maintenance other than calibration to an external standard.For the Escort ELF this is once a month for regular use or every 200 hours for coal mine dust sampling applications.For the Escort LC,this is recommended.
