## Upgrading graphite by flotation at Bogala Mines in Sri.
Graphite is naturally floatable due to its hydrophobic property and also soft and smears on other gangue particles,rendering the gangue more or less floatable too.Due to this reason it is important to concentrate on areas such as suitable flotation reagents,depression agents,pH modifiers,and particle size to be fed during the process.The paper surveys and analyses the suitable particle.Introduction to Mineral Processing Chevron Phillips ChemicalIntroduction to Mineral Processing.Froth Flotation Froth flotation is considered to be the most widely used method for ore beneficiation.In ore beneficiation,flotation is a process in which valuable minerals are separated from worthless material or other valuable minerals by inducing them to gather in and on the surface of a froth layer.

## Graphite flotation in the presence of sodium acetate
The results of flotation,in the form of flotation recovery of graphite as a function flotation time are shown in Figure 3.The graph indicates that depending on concentration,the flotation recovery of graphite can be slightly better or worse than that in distilled water.To see the extent of flotation change with sodium acetate concentration.Froth flotation WikipediaFroth flotation is a process for selectively separating hydrophobic materials from hydrophilic.This is used in mineral processing,paper recycling and waste water treatment industries.Historically this was first used in the mining industry,where it was one of the great enabling technologies of the 20th century.

## Graphite flotation in the presence of sodium acetate.
Graphite flotation in the presence of sodium acetate.Graphite was subjected to flotation in the presence of increasing concentration of sodium acetate.A comparison of graphite flotation with the surface tension,both as a function of the sodium acetate concentration in the aqueous solution,revealed a similar pattern of both relations.Graphite Processing Froth Flotation (Sulphide & Oxide.I would think that you are not too worried about maximising the size of the graphite particles so gentle attrition is the way forward.You need to have a way to physically separate the clay from the graphite before attempting the separation,which would probably consist of classification (depending how fine the graphite has become) then flotation in the presence of dispersant at low percent.
