Much like a tradition riffle.The awesome thing about the Riverhog riffle is that it can be trimmed to YOUR needed height,and to either a cut or throw angle.(Explained in the video) You can use it in ANY sluice as long as you match the water depth with the riffle height,but it's great for the top of dredges where water is rough as well.Randy's Keene Ultra Mini 4 Inch Dredge Sluice Box ModsDec 01,2017 · Now have a Keene 4 inch Ultra Mini dredge with air.smaller,easier for 1 man to operate,move.Trouble is the sluice box is designed for big gold,is only 40 inches long and single stage.To better catch the gold here in Kolorado,I have completely modified the sluice box for the fine,fine flood gold we have here on the Arkansas River.
