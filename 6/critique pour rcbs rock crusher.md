May 07,2018 · my first press was a Co Ax,and bought it in 1978.Just as tight and strait today as when I took it out of the box.I also own an RCBS (a U.S.made one),and the only it sees use is for bullet pulling and one operation in case forming.The RCBS does this easier.I'd suggest trying all the presses you can lay your hands on.Rock Chucker Solid Ram Accessory RCBSThe Solid Ram is a precision engineered reloading accessory for the RCBS Rock Chucker press.

I got this just after getting into shooting and it is the most awesomely fun thing to do.I've not blown up my rifle,so that's a good sign.All RCBS dies work great (as to be expected),and it can take any other reloading dies of the same thread size.
