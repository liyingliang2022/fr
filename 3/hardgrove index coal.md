## Hardgrove Grindability Index Wikipedia
Hardgrove Grindability Index (short HGI) is a measure for the grindability of coal.Grindability is an index,therefore it has no unit.The smaller the HGI,the harder is coal texture and less grindable is the coal.Grindability is an important factor for the design a coal mill.As grindability depends on many unknown factors,HGI is determined.Hardgrove Grindability Index (HGI) Mineral Labs Inc.Hardgrove Grindability Index analysis is the ASTM method of determining the hardness of coal when pulverized for steam generation or size reduction.Grindabilities typically range on coal from 35 110.Harder and less grindable coal rates a smaller HGI index number.
