## Cone Crusher an overview ScienceDirect Topics
The gyratory crusher has capacities starting from 1200 to above 5000 t h.To have a feed opening corresponding to that of a jaw crusher,the primary gyratory crusher must be much taller and heavier.Therefore,primary gyratories require quite a massive foundation.The cone crusher is a modified gyratory crusher.Effect of Feed Rock Size Distribution on Crusher PerformanceIf the ore feed to any gyratory or jaw crusher consisted entirely of large cubes or spheres of a size that would just barely enter the crushing chamber,the crusher could not be expected to produce anything like its normal rated capacity because the upper part of the crusher could not shatter the large pieces enough to keep the rest of the crushing chamber busy.Such a condition is of course.
