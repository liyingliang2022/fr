## to Placer Ilmenite Mineralogy and Sustainable Mining with.
Abstract: The placer mineral deposits along the east coast of India are known for the economic concentration of ilmenite,garnet,sillimanite,zircon,monazite,etc.Out of thismineral the ilmenite is most abundant followed by garnet and sillimanite.These resources are distributed in beach and dune environment of east coast.Private companies can no longer mine beaches in India.This is because,monazite is present in varying concentrations and grades across the coasts when these rare earth minerals are available.In an earlier amendment to the same rules in 2016,the Centre had fixed a maximum concentration of 0.75% monazite in the beach sands,exceeding which,private miners would not be allowed to mine.

## Spatial Variations in Particle Size and Magnetite.
This study examined spatial variations in the concentration,grain size and heavy mineral assemblages on Cedar Beach (Lake Erie,Canada).Magnetic studies of heavy mineral‐enriched,dark‐reddish sands present on the beach showed that magnetite (~150 μm) is the dominant magnetic mineral.CONCENTRATION PATTERN OF HEAVY MINERALS ALONG.mineral deposits of Odisha,but no literature is found related to heavy mineral deposits of Konark Ramachandi coast and their recovery [1 6].In this paper an attempt has been made to study on the textural and concentration pattern of heavy minerals in beach and dune sands of Konark Ramachandi coastal stretch,Odisha and the beneficiation.

## Alaska and California Beach Mining for Gold,Part II
Beach mining is the business of washing the sands of the ocean beach.Between Point Mendocino,in California,and the mouth of the Umpqua River,in Oregon,the beach sand contains gold,and in some places it is very rich.The beach is narrow,and lies at the foot of a bluff bank of auriferous sand.Presence of uranium and thorium in zircon assemblages.separation.The raw sands were processed in the pilot plant of Beach Sand Minerals Exploitation Centre (BSMEC).The plant is equipped with various gravity,electric,magnetic and grain size separators in order to separate five economically potential heavy minerals (magnetite,ilmenite,zircon,garnet,rutile).
