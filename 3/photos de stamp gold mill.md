## Stamp mill Wikipedia
A stamp mill consists of a set of heavy steel (iron shod wood in some cases) stamps,loosely held vertically in a frame,in which the stamps can slide up and down.They are lifted by cams on a horizontal rotating shaft.As the cam moves from under the stamp,the stamp falls onto the ore below,crushing the rock,and the lifting process is repeated at the next pass of the cam.Guide to Stamps and Inscriptions on Gold JewelryHowever,there are some common ones which make up the vast majority of the gold stamps.Authentic gold jewelry should have a stamp to indicate the purity of the gold in the piece.This mark can be in several different formats.For example: 585,14kt and 14K all mean 14 karat gold.
