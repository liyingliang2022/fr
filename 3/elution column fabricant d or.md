## Ion chromatography Wikipedia
Ion chromatography (or ion exchange chromatography) is a chromatography process that separates ions and polar molecules based on their affinity to the ion exchanger.It works on almost any kind of charged molecule—including large proteins,small nucleotides,and amino acids.However,ion chromatography must be done in conditions that are one unit away from the isoelectric point of a.OPTIMIZING THE OPERATING CONDITIONS OF GOLD.Tau Lekoa stream uses the Zadra process.The eluant is continuously circulated through the column and an electrowinning cell in series.A caustic cyanide solution,normally 0.2 to 0.5 % NaCN and 2% NaOH,is pumped to the elution column and is pre heated by the solution leaving the column.The temperature is further raised by a steam heat exchanger.

## Elution Wikipedia
Elution time and elution volume.The "elution time" of a solute is the time between the start of the separation (the time at which the solute enters the column) and the time at which the solute elutes.In the same way,the elution volume is the volume of eluent required to cause elution.Under standard conditions for a known mix of solutes in a.Introduction to Gradient Elution Introduction to.Introduction to Gradient Elution Sabine Heinisch,University of Lyon,France Abstract A gradient method is recommended for samples that cannot be easily separated by isocratic methods because of their wide k range.In gradient elution the eluent strength is increased during the separation by changing the composition of the mobile phase.
