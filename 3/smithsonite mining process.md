Zinc ore occurs in two types of deposit: as primary zinc ore in thin veins known as rakes,or a secondary deposit formed by weathering of the primary mineral veins.Zinc ore is most commonly found as zinc carbonate (ZnCO 3),known as calamine or smithsonite.It generally occurs as rounded,crystalline crusts or granular,honeycombed masses that.Metals and Metallurgy Encyclopedia of The Bible Bible.METALS AND METALLURGY.Metals comprise a large group of chemical elements which are distinguished from non metallic substances by their high conductivity for electricity and heat,properties resulting from the presence of "conduction" electrons that are free to move about within a metal,not being bound by specific atoms.Metals are also characterized by their high reflectivity for light.
