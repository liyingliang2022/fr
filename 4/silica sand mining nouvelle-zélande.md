## Wisconsin Geological & Natural History Survey » Frac sand.
Clean sand is stockpiled until it can be loaded into trucks for final sorting and drying off site.(Some mines sort and dry sand on site rather than sending it out.) Because the sand still contains moisture when it is stockpiled,drain tiles beneath the piles channel water to a lined process water pond.Australian Silica Quartz Pty LtdThe uses of silica are extremely diverse and there are a number of established and emerging markets for varying grades of silica sand and quartz products.High grade silica sands where the silica component is greater than 99.5% SiO 2 are used in the glass,LCD,TFT,ophthalmic,ceramic and other industries.
