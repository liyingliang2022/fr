## Cationic surfactants STOCKMEIER Chemie
In detergents,cationic surfactants enhance the action of anionic surfactants by reducing the surface tension between dirt and water,making them particularly suitable for removing grease stains.Unlike anionic surfactants,cationic surfactants can also be used in acidic environments and hard water,but their cleaning power is weaker.Acid Thickener Jangra Chemicals Private Limitedstability and 90% corrosion inhibition in hcl acid.We recommend dosage level of 1.3 to 1.8 % by weight.Our WCAT 400 is a synergistic blend of ethoxylates and quats which gives excellent thickening and disinfectant properties.Acid Thickener ATJAN 200: 1.5%: The cationic ethoxylated amines thickens the hydrochloric acid very effectively.
