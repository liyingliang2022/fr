## Crusher Wikipedia
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks,gravel,or rock dust.Crushers may be used to reduce the size,or change the form,of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled,or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore),so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.Jaw Crusher vs Cone Crusher: A ComparisonCone Crusher Benefits.Large feed openings can be paired with small discharge sizes,giving cone crushers a high crushing ratio.This makes the machines incredibly efficient,reducing the need for further crushing applications.Adding in the low operational costs to run the machine and you get a powerful tool with a small footprint.
