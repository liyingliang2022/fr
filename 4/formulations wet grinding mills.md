## Wet Grinding Basket and Media Mills for Particle Reduction
An Immersion Mill (a quantum improvement over traditional basket mills) combines mixing and milling achieving maximum particle size distribution,increasing production efficiency,and producing extraordinary quality and profitability.Immersion milling is a revolution in wet grinding dispersion technology that defies comparison.Mills for Wet Grinding and Dispersion : HCP Immersion MillThe Hockmeyer HCP Immersion Mill utilizes rapid recirculation milling technology to achieve a smaller particle size,and tighter particle distribution,faster than any other technology.This is achieved by pumping the slurry through the media field many more times and more efficiently than any other mill,including basket,horizontal or vertical mills.
