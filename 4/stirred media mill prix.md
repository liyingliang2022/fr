## Effect of the size of media on grinding performance in.
This work investigated the effect of grinding medium size on the wet milling performance in stirred mills using a combined numerical and experimental approach.Physical experiments were performed in a 1.4L stirred mill with the discs rotating at different speeds to grind aluminium hydroxide powders with different sized glass beads.The results showed that the.Fine Grinding Technology for Mines and Concentrating.The IsaMill (high capacity horizontal stirred mill) is referred to as an enabling technology.Through significantly lowering the cost of fine grinding,many locations that had high grade but fine grained ore became economical.Stirred mill technology energy efficiency is extremely dependent upon several variables including grinding media selection.

## Scale up of stirred media mills for fly ash grinding
2.2.Stirred media mill For the experiments,two stirred media mills were used.The 1 L mill was a KMAM 1B model and the 10 L mill was a KMA 10 model,both of which were made by Korea Mixing Technology (KMtech).The mills were similar in structure (Figure 1),and their detailed specifications are in Table 2.In the experiment,zirconia (ZrO 2.Stirred Media Detritors (SMD) MetsoStirred Media Detritor (SMD) is a fluidized media grinding mill.It utilizes the rotational energy of the impeller arms to impart a high energy motion to the media and slurry mixture inside the mill.This results in particle to particle shear and compressive forces that produce the desired grinding mechanism for fine grinding.Lower capital cost

## Estimation of Power during Dispersion in Stirred Media.
High precision control of the dispersion of aggregates in a stirred media mill requires a thorough understanding of the motion of multiphase flows.Here,we present numerical methods to study the dispersion mechanism and estimate the impact and fluid shear powers arising in such a mill.
