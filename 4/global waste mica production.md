## Production,use,and fate of all plastics ever made.
Plastics have outgrown most man made materials and have long been under environmental scrutiny.However,robust global information,particularly about their end of life fate,is lacking.By identifying and synthesizing dispersed data on production,use,and end of life management of polymer resins,synthetic fibers,and additives,we present the first global analysis of all mass produced.FAQ on Lush and Mica—Lush Cosmetics lushusaEliminating natural mica from production hasn't been an easy process as it meant we needed to put in place tighter controls and,of course,we didn't want to waste the stock that we already had.In 2016,natural mica was discovered in a range of mica pigments that we were told were synthetic.
