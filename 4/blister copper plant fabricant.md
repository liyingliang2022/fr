The blister copper is more than 98 percent pure,but it contains too much oxygen.The anode furnace blows natural gas into the melt to burn off the oxygen.At first,a tall yellow flame billows from the top of the anode furnace,but after a few hours it becomes a beautiful blue green when most of the oxygen in the copper has been burned away.New generation of Peirce Smith converter SMS groupThe Peirce Smith (PS) converter was introduced to the industry back in 1908.This reactor type is still the most widely applied process for producing blister and black copper.It is also common in nickel and PGM (Platinum group metals) production process lines.Ever since,it has been the predominant unit used in the production of blister copper.

## Copper extraction Wikipedia
Copper extraction refers to the methods used to obtain copper from its ores.The conversion of copper consists of a series of physical and electrochemical processes.Methods have evolved and vary with country depending on the ore source,local environmental regulations,and other factors.12.3 Primary Copper SmeltingConverting the matte yields a high grade "blister" copper,with 98.5 to 99.5 percent copper.Typically,blister copper is then fire refined in an anode furnace,cast into "anodes",and sent to an electrolytic refinery for further impurity elimination.Roasting is performed in copper smelters prior to charging reverberatory furnaces.In roasting,
