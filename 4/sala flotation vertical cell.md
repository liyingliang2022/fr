Mar 16,2019 · 1.Introduction.The first order kinetic model is commonly used to describe the flotation process (Ahmed and Jameson,1985,Sutherland,1948).For a given recovery,higher flotation kinetic rate constants lead to the need for a shorter residence time of the slurry in the flotation cell,thus offering the potential for reducing the volume capacity of the flotation cell.StackCell® Flotation Eriez Flotation DivisionA new high capacity flotation technology,the StackCell,has been developed as an alternative to both conventional and column flotation machines.This technology makes use of a pre aerated,high shear feed canister that provides efficient bubble particle contacting,thereby substantially shortening the residence time required for coal flotation.
