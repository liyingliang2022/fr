## Concrete Retarders: It's Uses,Mechanism & Pros Cons
Concrete retarders are also Known as retarding admixtures or retarders.Concrete retarders are added in the concrete to delay the setting time of the concrete.As you know,the procedure of setting or stiffening is a result of a chemical reaction between water and cement in the concrete.Don't Power Trowel Blindly Concrete Moisture Test SpecPower trowels offer a great option for smoothing large concrete slabs and getting the slab to a hard,level finish.But timing is key,and trying to rush the concrete power trowel process can actually slow the project and add cost by limiting the porous nature of the slab that allows the concrete moisture to evaporate from the surface during the drying process.
