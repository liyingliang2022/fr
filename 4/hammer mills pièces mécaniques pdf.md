hammer mill,disc refiner,pin mill,chain mill).Long pieces of straw stalk of biomass may not flow easily into grinders such as hammer and disc refiners.Hence,biomass needs to be preprocessed or chopped with a knife mill to accommodate bulk flow,densification,and uniformity of feed rate.Direct measures of mechanical energy for knife mill size.130 kWh Mg for both hammer and knife mills whereas the hammer mill required more energy (115 kWh Mg) than a knife mill (50 kWh Mg) to reduce the size of the hardwood chips to 3.2 mm particle size.They observed that the energy required to grind agricultural straw and corn stover was about 6 36% of the energy to grind wood.
