Abraham de Moivre,when he came up with this formula,had to assure that the points of inflection were exactly one standard deviation away from the center,and so that it was bell shaped,as well as make sure that the area under the curve was exactly equal to one.And somehow they came up with the standard normal distribution,which is as follows:Derivative of a Bézier CurveDerivative of a Bernstien Polynomial (*junk*) Derivative of a Bezier Curve and Hodograph.Formula 1: Let (*junk*) be a Bezier curve.Check it!

MAS.864: Derivation of 2D Boltzmann Distribution Dhaval Adjodah MIT May 16,2011.The yellow curve is the 3D t,the red curve is the analytical t,while the blue curve is the non linear t with least square determined = 1:00926482,= 2.03568257 and = 1.0649113.CURVATURE University of Hawaiicircle (or indeed any horizontal curve),but clearly one does not want the curvature to be0inthiscase.For a curve in 3 space,we still want the curvature to be equal to the rate at which the tangent to the curve turns as one moves along the curve at a speed of one,but we need to nd a way of de.
