What is coal gasification,the project at Talcher? Coal gasification is the process of converting coal into synthesis gas (also called syngas),which is a mixture of hydrogen (H2),carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2).The syngas can be used in a variety of applications such as in the production of electricity and making chemical.coalpetrography.comtion of a coal as noted above.is the major factor determining the amount and kind of mineral species present in coal.Although there is little doubt that some minerals present in coal are detrital,a large proportion are authigenic.Therefore an evaluation of mineral assemblages can suggest the physico chemical conditions in the peat swamps.
