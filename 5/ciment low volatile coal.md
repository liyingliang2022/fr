Following a government change in policy in early 2018,all coal fired power generation in the UK will end by October 2025 and as such will no longer form part of the UK power source in the very near future.West Cumbria coals are known to be high volatile,hard coking coal.They have: Very low ash levels thus reduced waste materialBituminous coal coal classification BritannicaHigh volatile bituminous coal is classified on the basis of its calorific value on a moist,ash free basis (ranging from 24 to 33 megajoules per kilogram; 10,500 to 14,000 British thermal units per pound),while medium volatile and low volatile bituminous coals are classified on the basis of the percentage of fixed carbon present on a dry,ash.
