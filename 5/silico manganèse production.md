## Ore Melting and Reduction in Silicomanganese Production.
The charge for silicomangansese production consists of manganese ore (often mixed with ferromanganese slag) dolomite or calcite,quartz,and in some cases,other additions.These materials have different melting properties,which have a strong effect on reduction and smelting reactions in the production of a silicomanganese alloy.This article discusses properties of Assman,Gabonese,and.Silico Manganese in Cement Production CarbonSilico Manganese in Cement Production.After the process described above the material that remains is made up of around 40% silica,20% lime,16% aluminium oxide and 10 14% manganese oxides.The iron oxide content generally comes in at around 2%.
