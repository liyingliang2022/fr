## Impact of Shocks on Australian Coal Mining
As compared to black coal,brown coal (lignite) has a lower energy and higher ash and water content.Therefore,the Greenhouse Gas emissions related to conversion of brown coal to energy are very high.Brown coal is usually unsuitable for export and is used in Australia for electricity generation inCoal in Australia WikipediaCoal is mined in every state of Australia.Mining occurs mainly in Queensland,New South Wales and Victoria.[citation needed] About 75% of coal mined in Australia is exported,mostly to eastern Asia,and of the balance most is used in electricity generation.Coal production in Australia increased 13.6% between 2005 and 2010 and 5.3% between 2009 and 2010.
