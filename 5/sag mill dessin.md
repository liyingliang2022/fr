SAG is an acronym for semi autogenous grinding.SAG mills are autogenous mills that also use grinding balls like a ball mill.A SAG mill is usually a primary or first stage grinder.SAG mills use a ball charge of 8 to 21%.The largest SAG mill is 42' (12.8m) in diameter,powered by a 28 MW (38,000 HP) motor.Grinding circuit design principles Matallurgy SRK.Grinding circuit design principles.For semi autogenous grinding (SAG) mills,there are two basic forms of testing: single particle breakage and tumbling tests designed to recreate the actual mill environment.For high pressure grinding rolls and regrind mill sizing,a specific test designed for that piece of equipment is best.

## SINGLE STAGE SAG AG MILLING DESIGN
SINGLE STAGE SAG AG MILLING DESIGN ABSTRACT Single stage semi autogenous autogenous (S AG) milling has become a common design for a variety of ore types with the advantages of being comparatively low capital cost and flexible for future expansion.The single stage(PDF) DESIGN OF AG SAG MILL CIRCUITS USING THE SMC TESTThese equations are used by SMCC Pty Ltd to estimate the specific energy of AG SAG mills under all normal operating conditions,eg ball load,mill speed,feed size and ore hardness and for all.

## Achieving SAG Mill Design Production at Start Up Using.
Achieving SAG Mill Design Production at Start Up Using.and from this to conclude whether starting up at design tonnage in a SAG mill can be a fact or just wishful thinking on the part of the engineers who design the plant using SAG technology.Autogenous mills were introduced into the iron ore mining industry in the 1950's to eliminate.SAGDesign Test Starkey and Associates Inc.Typically,Starkey & Associates recommends SAG mill circuits followed by a ball mill(s) working in series with the SAG mill.The quantity of mills or pebble crushers recommended is dependent upon the ore hardness,design plant throughput,and final product size desired for ideal liberation.
