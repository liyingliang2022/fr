## The effect of ball size on mill performance ScienceDirect
The specific rates of breakage of particles in a tumbling ball mill are described by the equation S i = ax α i (Q(z),where Q(z) is the probability function which ranges from 1 to 0 as particle size increases.This equation produces a maximum in S,and the particle size of the maximum is related to ball diameter by x m = k 1 d 2.The variation of a with ball diameter was found to be of the form.
