## Cone crushers Metso
Cone crushers are very suitable for size reduction and shaping in the downstream of a crushing circuit.They reduce the material in a crushing cavity by continuous compression between a fixed element (bowl liner) and a moving element (mantle).Crushing Equipment,Cone Crushers,Gyratory CrushersCone crushers and gyratory crushers are mainly used as secondary crushers in a crushing plant.Crushed product from the primary crusher (usually Jaw Crusher) is fed through the top of the cone crusher and flows over the mantle.A vertical drive shaft rotates the mantle eccentrically below the bowl liner,squeezing the product and crushing it.

## What is the eccentric throw? — Sandvik Mining and Rock.
The mantle in a cone crusher spins in conical pendulum motion.That means it doesn't stay in the center of the chamber it sweeps around moving closer and further away from the concave.This is what creates the crushing action.At a given point on the concave,material is crushed when the mantle is closest,and it falls down the chamber.Cone Crusher Hydraulic Cone Crusher Manufacturer from.A Cone Crusher is one of the main types of primary crushers in a mine or ore processing plant.Gyratory cone crushers are designated in size either by the gape and mantle diameter or by the size of the receiving opening.Gyratory cone crushers can be used for primary or secondary crushing.
