## Space Exploration (Advantages vs.Disadvantages) Soapboxie
Yet,there are many opinions about whether space exploration is worthwhile.Some people feel that the disadvantages of a national space program far outweigh the benefits.Many others believe that space exploration should be continued at all costs,that it has proven to be beneficial in the past,and that it will continue to do so.Colonialism,Nationalism,NeocolonialismSettlement colonies vs.Exploitation Colonies Settlement Colonies: Permanent settlers,identify with colony Cultivated and took possession of the land Pushed indigenous people out Exploitation Colonies More focused on economic,political,and strategic use of the colony,did not.identify with colony

Longwall mining is a form of underground coal mining where a long wall of coal is mined in a single slice (typically 1 2 m thick).The longwall "panel" (the block of coal that is being mined) is typically 3 4 km long and 250 400 m wide.Longwall mining produced 176 million tons of coal in 2007,about 15 percent of total U.S.production.Formation of methane hazard in longwall coal mines with.1.Introduction.Increased methane emission into longwall areas,observed over the last two decades,is a result of increased production capacity and exploitation of longwalls in the seams of higher saturation with methane,which is directly associated with the mining depth.
