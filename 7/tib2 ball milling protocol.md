TiC TiB2 composite ceramics were successfully fabricated via planetary ball milling of 72 mass% Ti and 28 mass % B4C powders,followed by low temperature sintering process at 1200°C.The microstructure of the ball milled powder mixtures and composite ceramics were characterized by Differential thermal analysis equipment (DTA),field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and X ray.Graphene‐Assisted Preparation of in‐situ TiC‐TiB2 Al.In order to increase the degree of dispersion of the particles,the GNPs were coated on the surface of the B4C particles by high‐energy ball milling before sintering.The as‐spun inoculant ribbons were added to the melt of a typical Al‐Si alloy to verify its effect of refining the grains on aluminum alloys.

## Aluminium magnesium boride Wikipedia
Aluminum magnesium boride or Al 3 Mg 3 B 56 colliqually known as BAM is a chemical compound of aluminium,magnesium and boron.Whereas its nominal formula is AlMgB 14,the chemical composition is closer to Al 0.75 Mg 0.75 B 14.It is a ceramic alloy that is highly resistive to wear and has an extremely low coefficient of sliding friction,reaching a record value of 0.02 in lubricated AlMgB 14.Synthesis of Nanomaterials by High Energy Ball MillingSynthesis of Nanomaterials by High Energy Ball Milling W.Cao.Skyspring Nanomaterials,Inc.It is a ball milling process where a powder mixture placed in the ball mill is subjected to high energy collision from the balls.This process was developed by Benjamin and his coworkers at the International Nickel Company in the late of 1960.
