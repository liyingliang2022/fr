## A study of leakage rates through mine seals in underground.
Seals are widely used in underground US coal mines to isolate mined out workings,thereby reducing the ventilation load for the mine.With increased longwall panel sizes being realised by current mining equipment,large,mined out areas of coal mines must be either ventilated or isolated from active workings by mine seals.How Underground Mining Works HowStuffWorksUnderground mines are the alternative to surface mines.Surface mines excavate from the top down,a method that can become inefficient at depths greater than about 200 feet (60 meters) [sources: Illinois Coal Association,De Beers].Undergrounds coal mines can drive 2,500 feet (750 meters) into the Earth and other types even deeper uranium mines can reach 6,500 feet,or 2 kilometers.
