## : Lab 1: Measurement and Uncertainty Pendulum Period
: Lab 1: Measurement and Uncertainty Pendulum Period Introduction Physics is primarily an experimental science.Physics theories are tested and refined and are only retained when they are proven to be an accurate description of nature.The key concept that distinguishes experimental science from theoretical science is uncertainty.The Lagrangian Method Harvard Universitythe equations.In general,the safest method for solving a problem is to use the Lagrangian method and then double check things with F = ma and or ¿ = dL=dt if you can. At this point it seems to be personal preference,and all academic,whether you use the Lagrangian method or the F = ma method.The two methods produce the same equations.

## Earthquake Resistance Techniques To Protect Against.
Pendulum Power: The pendulum power technique works by suspending a huge mass near the top of the structure.This mass is supported by steel cables and viscous fluid dampers are placed between the mass and the building that it protects.In case of any seismic activity,the pendulum moves in the opposite direction to balance the energy.Dimensional analysis Rice University[m] mass [l] length [g] length time 2 [t] time three dimensions.Simple pendulum So,we should be able to find 3 independent dimensionless parameters.• Note that m is the only variable to contain the mass unit.Therefore it cannot be part of any dimensionless parameters there's no way to "cancel" out the mass.
