May 03,2017 · In this video I have tried to describe the crystal sheets in clayey soils and clay minerals Hello everyone,hope you liked the video.This is an educational platform set up IIT Bombay Graduates.Introduction to Clay Minerals & SoilsClay minerals are layer silicates that are formed usually as products of chemical weathering of other silicate minerals at the earth's surface.They are found most often in shales,the most common type of sedimentary rock.In cool,dry,or temperate climates,clay minerals are fairly stable and are an important component of soil.
