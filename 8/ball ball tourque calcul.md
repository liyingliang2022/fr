## Low Friction Bearing Calculator (ball & roller) CalQlata
Ball bearings are an anti friction device for two differentially rotating bodies.They are narrower than roller bearings and normally comprise a hardened inner case,a hardened outer case and a number of high strength,very hard ball bearings,all of which are normally held together by a specially designedConverting Between Linear Force and Torque of a Ballscrew.Torque = Force x Distance = (Rotational Force acting on a ball bearing) x (radius of ballscrew) So you can calculate the rotational vector component of force based on torque and the radius of the ballscrew.T = F1 x D 2,where: F1 is the vector component (tangent to the ballscrew) of the force applied by the screw onto the ball
