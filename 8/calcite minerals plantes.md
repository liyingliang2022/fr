Calcite is a carbonate mineral and the most stable polymorph of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).The Mohs scale of mineral hardness,based on scratch hardness comparison,defines value 3 as "calcite".Other polymorphs of calcium carbonate are the minerals aragonite and vaterite.Fossils Window to the pastThe common minerals that form this kind of fossils are calcite,iron,and silica.Since the pores of the organic tissues are filled with minerals or the organic matter is replaced with minerals,the fossils are formed in the original shape of the tissue or organism,but the composition of the fossils will be different and they will be heavier.
