## Longwall Mining
Longwall miners extract "panels" rectangular blocks of coal as wide as the mining machinery and as long as 12,000 feet (3,650 meters).Massive shearers cut coal from a wall face,which falls onto a conveyor belt for removal.As a longwall miner advances along a panel,the roof behind the miner's path is allowed to collapse.Mining WikipediaOther methods include shrinkage stope mining,which is mining upward,creating a sloping underground room,long wall mining,which is grinding a long ore surface underground,and room and pillar mining,which is removing ore from rooms while leaving pillars in place to support the roof of the room.
