If the mill is restarted without first removing the hot coal,an explosion can occur when particles are suspended and exposed to the in rushing combustion air.Even in routine mill shutdowns,there is a danger that any residual coal left within the mill will oxidise,and may explode as the mill is restarted.Pulverizers 101: Part I POWER MagazineCombustion of coal particles beneath the grinding zone is not a serious problem,as long as the mill is in operation.But if a mill trips or a boiler has a main fuel trip,then fires in the.

## Pulverizer Wikipedia
To summarize the coal mill controls,they may be divided basically into two major categories:.1.To control the quality of coal being sent to the burners located on the furnace walls.The word quality here means the temperature and fineness of the PF.The set temperature values are dependent on the percentage of volatile matter that exists in the main fuel.Flexible operation of coal fired power plants Processing.Only after this was achieved and another coal mill was connected,the backup fire was reduced or switched off.Thus,defined load conditions for sole coal operation were at 30 to 40 percent.Furthermore,at least two coal mills were common or planned for this mode of operation.
