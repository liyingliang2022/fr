## CONVENTIONAL SUPPLY OF OIL WILL SLOW DOWN Oil & Gas.
Two major companies,who are pioneers in oil mining and extraction Suncor and Syncrude have been producing synthetic crude for many years by surface mining.The thick oil in the surface ranges.Why Venezuela is Alberta's biggest competitor Oil Sands.Thanks to proximity to the equator,oil sands deposits in Venezuela are closer to 50°C,much warmer than Alberta's oil sands which tend to average closer to 20°C deep underground and just 5°C close to the surface.That means much less energy is required to bring the oil to a flowing temperature.2.Simpler geology:

## Oil sands
Surface mining.Since Great Canadian Oil Sands (now Suncor) started operation of its mine in 1967,bitumen has been extracted on a commercial scale from the Athabasca Oil Sands by surface mining.In the Athabasca sands there are very large amounts of bitumen covered by little overburden,making surface mining.Orinoco Belt Surface Mining Oil SandThe Athabasca Oil Sands in Alberta is the largest bitumen deposit in Canada and the only one accessible to surface mining,although recent technological breakthroughs have resulted in deeper deposits becoming available by in situ methods.In Venezuela,the Orinoco Belt contains huge deposits of oil sands,known as the Orinoco Oil Sands.

## Athabasca tar sands WikiAlpha
The Athabasca tar sands or Athabasca oil sands are large deposits of bitumen or extremely heavy crude oil,located in northeastern Alberta,Canada roughly centred on the boomtown of Fort McMurray.These tar sands,hosted in the McMurray Formation,consist of a mixture of crude bitumen (a semi solid form of crude oil),silica sand,clay minerals,and water.Oil sands Geology engineeringOct 02,2019 · Oil sands are either loose sands or partially consolidated sandstone containing a naturally occurring mixture of sand,clay,and water,saturated with a dense and extremely viscous form of petroleum technically referred to as bitumen (or colloquially tar due to.

Except for a fraction of the extra heavy oil or bitumen which can be extracted by conventional oil well technology,oil sands must be produced by strip mining or the oil made to flow into wells using sophisticated in situ techniques.These methods usually use more water and require larger amounts of energy than conventional oil extraction.The Future of the Canadian Oil SandsFebruary 2016 The Future of the Canadian Oil Sands: Growth potential of a unique resource amidst regulation,egress,cost,and price uncertainty 5 Preface This research was conceived with two central objectives: first,to help a global audience comprehend the uniqueness of the massive hydrocarbon resource that is Canada's oil sands.
