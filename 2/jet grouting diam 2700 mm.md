## Jet Grouting Procedure,Applications and Advantages for.
Jet grouting is a ground improvement or soil stabilization method.Methods,procedures,applications and advantages of jet grouting is discussed in this article.A study on the history of jet grouting and the present demand of jet grouting method as a ground improvement technique makes us clear.Soil Inclusions in Jet Grout Columns Dan Brown and.soil within the column are required.Clearly,jet grouting is more technically demanding,and less forgiving,than perhaps other ground improvement methodologies,e.g.slurry walls,as this case study suggests.The jet grouting process begins by drilling a borehole,typically 6 in (150 mm) in diameter.The borehole is held open using drilling mud
