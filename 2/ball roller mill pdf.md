## Cement grinding Vertical roller mills versus ball mills
The grinding process in ball mills and vertical roller mills differ fundamentally.In a ball mill the comminution takes place by impact and attrition.The comminution in the vertical roller mill takes place by exposing a bed of material to a pressure sufficiently high to cause fracture of the individual particles in the bed,although the.Roller Mill Maintenance00Roller mills are also more sensitive to instantaneous changes in the feed rate than are other pieces of process equipment.Feeding a roller mill directly from a screw conveyor or bucket elevator will cause surges in the feed rate that the roller mill "sees" instantaneously unless some damping system such as a surge hopper is used.
