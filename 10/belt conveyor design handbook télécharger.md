## Roller Conveyors
Overview Lineshaft Powered Roller Conveyors The most versatile and economical conveyor available in material handling.For complex configurations of conveyors fewer drives are required compared to conventional equipment.Another unique advantage of Lineshaft Conveyor is the number of ancillaryConstruction and Maintenance of Belt Conveyors for Coal.6 Construction and Maintenance of Belt Conveyors for Coal and Bulk Material Handling Plants also oscillating horizontally.This phenomenon results in internal agitation to the material on belt and therefore the material's external faces assume inclination at surcharge angle.
