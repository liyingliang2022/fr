## Working principle of Ball Mill ball cement milling.
Mar 03,2015 · Ball mill is an efficient tool for grinding many materials into fine powder.The Ball Mill is used to grind many kinds of mine and other materials,or to select the mine.It is widely used in.Comminution '10,Cape Town,South Africa,April 13 16.of the grinding mill.The proof of the modeling concepts is shown for a 90 cm laboratory scale ball mill.The material used in the study was limestone.In the batch mill,approximately a 10 kg mass of limestone in the 32x25 mm size was ground with 100 kg of 50 mm steel ball.

## Ball Mill Design Power Calculation
The basic parameters used in ball mill design (power calculations),rod mill or any tumbling mill sizing are; material to be ground,characteristics,Bond Work Index,bulk density,specific density,desired mill tonnage capacity DTPH,operating % solids or pulp density,feed size as F80 and maximum 'chunk size',product size as P80 and maximum and finally the type of circuit open closed.
