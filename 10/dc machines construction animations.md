## Construction and Principle of Operation of the Shunt DC Motor
The DC Shunt wound motor,running on Direct current,has its field windings placed in parallel to the armature.In Electrical terms,parallel is generally denoted as shunt.That is the reason behind naming it a DC Shunt motor.Same voltage is applied to both shunt winding and armature in this motor.This parallel configuration allows independent path of current for field winding and armature.DC Machine Construction,Working,Types,EMF Equation.A DC machine is an electromechanical energy alteration device.The working principle of a DC machine is when electric current flows through a coil within a magnetic field,and then the magnetic force generates a torque which rotates the dc motor.The DC machines are classified into two types such as DC generator as well as DC motor.
